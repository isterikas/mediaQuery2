      <h1>Simplicity and work</h1>
      <p>
        Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins
        their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your
        work life as simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.

      <h1>Simple decorations</h1>
      <p>
        A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't
        decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were
        hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to
        and make things pop like never before.
